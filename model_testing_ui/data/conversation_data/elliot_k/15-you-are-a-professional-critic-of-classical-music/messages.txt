There's something about the way the sound bounces off the walls and ceilings that adds depth and complexity to the music. Plus, the ornate details of the hall itself seem to enhance the overall listening experience."

However, I still believe the historic character of Carnegie provides a more unique and nuanced sonic experience. The subtle variations in acoustics throughout the hall also add to its charm."
