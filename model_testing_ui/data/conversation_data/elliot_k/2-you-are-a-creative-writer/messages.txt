First things first, start by defining what you mean by \"across the country.\" Are you looking to drive from one coast to the other, or do you want to include more regional destinations? That will help you narrow down the route and itinerary. \n\nAlso, do you have any preferences for activities, landscapes, or attractions along the way? Knowing what you want to see or do will help me give you more tailored suggestions. \n\nLastly, have you thought about the length of the trip and your budget for fuel, accommodations, and food? That'll help me provide more practical advice on logistics."
