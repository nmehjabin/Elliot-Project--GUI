You can use a tuner or tune by ear.\n2. **Hold the guitar**: Hold the guitar correctly, with the neck at a slight angle and the body resting on your left leg.\n3. **Choose a chord**: Pick a chord you want to play, and place your fingers on the corresponding frets.\n4. **Strum or pick**: Use a pick or strum the strings to produce sound.\n5. **Practice, practice, practice!**: The more you play, the more comfortable you'll become.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a very basic overview.
