1. **Tune your guitar**: Get your guitar tuned to the right pitch. You can use a tuner or tune by ear.
2. **Hold the guitar**: Hold the guitar correctly, with the neck at a slight angle and the body resting on your left leg.
3. **Choose a chord**: Pick a chord you want to play, and place your fingers on the corresponding frets.
4. **Strum or pick**: Use a pick or strum the strings to produce sound.
5. **Practice, practice, practice!**: The more you play, the more comfortable you'll become.

Keep in mind, this is a very basic overview. Want to learn more? I can give you some resources for online tutorials and lessons!</s><|assistant|>
